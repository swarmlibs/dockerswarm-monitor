# About

A comprehensive guide to Docker Swarm monitoring with Prometheus Stack.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is a work in progress and is not yet ready for production use.
> But feel free to test it and provide feedback.

## Stacks

- [promstack](https://github.com/swarmlibs/promstack): A Docker Stack deployment for the monitoring suite for Docker Swarm includes (Grafana, Prometheus, cAdvisor, Node exporter and Blackbox prober exporter)
- [logstack](https://github.com/swarmlibs/logstack): Like Promstack, but for logs. Includes (Grafana Loki and Promtail)

## Architecture Overview
This is the architecture overview of the whole system working together.

We are using the Grafana Labsâ€™ opinionated observability stack which includes: Loki-for logs, Grafana - for dashboards and visualization, Tempo - for traces, and Mimir - for metrics.
